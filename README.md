- By pressing and holding the button, 7 (virtual) Dragon Balls will be scattered to "a random latitude and longitude within a radius of 480 meters from the current location".
- The Dragon Balls are not real, but only visible on the Dragon Radar.
- The location of the Dragon Ball is constantly updated on the radar screen, centered on the current location.
- Pressing the button toggles between "Zoomed-In" and "Zoomed-Out" mode.
- In the Zoomed-Out mode, the distance from the current location to the farthest Dragon Ball is displayed, and the scale is automatically adjusted accordingly.
- In Zoomed-In mode, the scale is fixed at 40m radius, and the nearest Dragon Ball is locked and the distance to it is displayed.
- The distance and direction are used to find the Dragon Ball.
- When you get close to the locked Dragon Ball within 5m radius, you can get the Dragon Ball.
- When you collect 7 Dragon Balls, a dragon appears on the screen.

Dragon Balls are not always found on the side of the road, but sometimes they are in someone's house or in the middle of a field, and you cannot get close to them.
In such cases, "shuffle" is used.

- If you press and hold the button while in the "Zoomed-In" mode, the locked Dragon Ball will fly to a different location. (Can be used up to 7 times).

If there is a Dragon Ball that cannot be got even after using up the shuffle, the last resort is "Reset".

- If you press and hold the button while in "Zoomed-Out" mode, all the Dragon Balls, including those you have already collected, will fly somewhere else.

In other words, the game is over and you have to start over.

In fact, you will have to shuffle and reset quite often, so it is very rare to get to the dragon.
In addition, shuffling and resetting will send you to "a radius of 480 meters around the place where you did it," so if you repeat it, you may find yourself further and further away from home.

In this way, the game is designed to provide a challenging and mysterious adventure experience.
